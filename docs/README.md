# Top level documentation

This repository aims to interconnect all ADI's documentations and wikis.
```
(cd docs; make html)
```
The output will be written to `docs/_build/html`.


It also aims to generate a single/monolithic output of all ADI's sphinx docs.
```
./monolithic.sh
```
The output will be written to `docs-mono/_build/html`.
